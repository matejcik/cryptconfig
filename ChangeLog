	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Fix two bugs in disable_pam_mount ().  Both of them caused 367255.

2008-03-04  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Specify the permissions when using open with O_CREAT.

2008-03-04  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig.h:
	* src/cryptconfig.c:
	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Add public data support.  We use a very simple approach.  We create a
	public directory, /home/.$USER.  Any public data is moved from the 
	encrypted home directory to the public directory.  We then place symlinks
	in the encrypted home directory and the unencrypted home directory that
	point to the public data.  The public data is available whether the
	encrypted home directory is mounted or not.

	This is adds two new commands pd-add and pd-remove.  They each take a
	list of relative or absolute paths rooted in the encrypted home directory.

	* run-cc-tests.py:

	Add public data tests.

2007-11-08  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:
	
	Add support for parsing the new pam_mount xml
	config file.

	Use pam-config to add pam_mount and pam_cryptpass
	to the pam service files instead of doing it
	myself.

	Update the unit tests.

2007-11-02  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Don't fail if 
	the pam service files don't exist.  This fixes
	326794.

2007-07-09  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/*: Add memory locking to protect passphrases and
	decrypted key data.

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Use O_LARGEFILE to open the image.

	* src/cryptconfig.c: Retain the permissions of the key
	when changing the password.

2007-07-06  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* cryptconfig.spec: Update the Requires and BuildRequires.

	* configure.in:

	Remove the check for the losetup binary.  Fix the checks for
	the crypto and pam headers.

	* src/Makefile.am:

	Remove the check for the losetup binary.

	* src/cryptconfig.c:

	Use parse_size () to allow sizes like "1G" or "200M".

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Add parse_size().
	Rename is_pam_mount_setup_for_user() to pam_mount_is_setup_for_user().

	Use LOOP_SET_FD and LOOP_CLR_FD ioctls instead of execing losetup.
	
	* src/pam_cryptpass.c: simplify get_key_file().

2007-03-29  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:
	
	Fix the copy_user_data() function to make sure dot directories are getting
	copied.  This fixes 259113.

	* run-cc-tests.py: Update to check for dot directories.
	
2007-03-05  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/pam_cryptpass.c: 

	Implement pam_sm_open_session() and pam_sm_close_session().  This lets us
	hook into the session stack, before pam_mount, to verify that the authtok
	being used can decrypt the image key.  If it can't then we can prompt
	for the key password and sync the two.  This provides a much nicer
	experience for users of non-local auth mechanisms.
	
	* src/cryptconfig.c:
	
	Make root the owner of the unencrypted home directory.  This is to avoid
	confusion if the user logs in from a service that doesn't have pam_mount
	in the stack.  This fixes 245698.

	Add a flag, --remove-data, that will remove the data in the user's
	unencrypted home directory after it's been copied to the encrypted image.

	* src/cryptconfig.h:

	Remove unused PAM_PASSWD_CONF define.

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Move the list of passwd services to cryptconfig.conf and add gnome-passwd
	to the default list.

	Add pam_cryptpass.so to the pam session stack before pam_mount to ensure
	that the key file is in sync with the user's password.

	Rename a few static functions to make them more accurate.

	* run-cc-tests.py: update unit tests.

2007-02-26  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Add an entry in cryptconfig.conf for pam passwd
	services we need to modify and add gnome-passwd to the default list.

2007-02-21  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Add a check against a key file size threshold
	to avoid interger overflow attacks.  This helps fix 243881.

2007-02-20  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Remove 'su' from the list of pam config files
	to edit.  This fixes Bug 245702.

	* src/pam_cryptpass.c:
	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: 

	Replace chown and g_stat with fchown and fstat to
	avoid potential symlink issues.

	Use "--" to prevent user's from adding additional command-line options
	to apps that we exec.

	Use flock() to avoid races if multiple instances cryptconfig are running.

	* src/cryptconfig.c: s/umask(022)/umask(077)/
	
	These changes fix the issues in Bug 243881.

2007-02-14  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Use 64-bit versions of lseek ()
	when enlarging and creating an image.

2007-02-05  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* run-cc-tests.py: New file for unit tests.

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c: Add unlock_image()

	Look for the full file path in loop_find_devs_from_image() when
	figuring out which loop device is being used.

	Make get_passphrase() stop reading input if it encounters a newline.

	* src/cryptconfig.c:  Correctly check the return value for
	add_key_file_to_device() in the create-image command.

	Refactor code for getting a passphrase and unlocking an image
	to unlock_image().

	Only call luks_close() if we've actually setup a map device.

	Add mount flags to allow the open and close commands to mount
	and umount the image device.

	Don't allow encrypted home directories to be created for the root user.

2007-01-23  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig.c:  Set umask to 022 and avoid trying to copy
	data during the make-ehd command if the user's home dir doesn't exist.
	This can happen for	AD users.

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Add xdm to the default pam services list.

	Refactor some file filtering code down to filter_file ().

	Merge a patch from dgollub@suse.de that fixes a file creation bug.

2007-01-22  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* src/cryptconfig-lib.c:

	Escape '\' character in the user name before we add an entry
	in pam_mount.conf.  This is needed for AD users since their
	user name is normally DOMAIN\user.

2007-01-17  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* cryptconfig.spec:
	* Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/cryptconfig.h:
	* src/cryptconfig.c:

	Add cryptconfig.conf.  Right now it only contains the list of
	pam services we modify when enabling pam_mount.  Add get_pam_services (),
	which parses cryptconfig.h or falls back to a default list of services.

	* src/cryptconfig.c:  Add the O_TRUNC flag to crappy_rename ().  Change
	enable/disable_pam_mount_services to use get_pam_services ().

	* src/cryptconfig.h: Bump KEY_DATA_SIZE to 256 bytes.

2007-01-12  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* Add the open and close commands.

2007-01-04  Chris Rivera  <crivera@novell.com>

	* Initial import.
